In causal models, the path coefficients are not necessarily the correlations. To find the path coefficients we need to use the *tracing rule*. The tracing rule indicates that:\n\n<blockquote>\nThe correlation between two variables *X* and *Y* is equal to the sum of the possible products of all possible paths from each possible tracing from *X* to *Y*, with the following two exceptions:\n\n- The same variable is not entered more than once in the same tracing.\n- A variable is not both entered and exited through an arrowhead.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n## Example of the Tracing Rule\n\nAs an example, consider all the tracings (routes) that allow us to start at the academic ability variable and go to the achievement variable in the path diagram at right. \n\n:::: {.columns}\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../img/path-analysis-notes/03-weak-causal-path.png){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\nThere are two possible tracings that conform to the tracing rule:\n\n1. Start at the academic ability variable and take p1 to the achievement variable.\n2. Start at the academic ability variable and take p2 to the motivation variable, then take p3 to the achievement variable.\n\n:::\n\n::::\n\n\n## Example of the Tracing Rule (cntd.)\n\nSimilarly, we could have started at the achievement variable and determined the tracings to get to the academic ability variable:\n\n:::: {.columns}\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../img/path-analysis-notes/03-weak-causal-path.png){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n1.

Start at the achievement variable and take p3 to the motivation variable, then take p2 to the academic ability variable.\n\n:::\n\n::::\n\n## Important Note Regarding the Tracing Rule\n\nNote that when we are considering tracings, we do not have to worry about the direction of the arrow, only that there is a path we can trace. The only rule regarding arrowheads is that a variable can not be both entered and exited through an arrowhead.\n\n\n## Back to Estimating the Path Coeffients\n\nEach tracing yields a product of the path coefficents used in the tracing. Thus the first tracing is $p1$ (there is only one path, so the product is simply the path), and the second tracing yields $p2 \\times p3$. Since the tracing rule says that the correlation between academic ability and achievement is equal to the sum of the products yielded by the tracings, we know that:\n\n$$\n\\begin{split}\nr_{\\mathrm{academic~ability,~ achievement}} &= p1 + p2(p3) \\\\[1em]\n.737 &= p1 + p2(p3)\n\\end{split}\n$$\n\n## Your Turn\n\nUse the tracing rule to write two more equations. The first equation should represent the correlation between motivation and achievement, and the second equation should represent the correlation between ability and motivation.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../img/path-analysis-notes/03-weak-causal-path.png){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Check Your Work\n\n:::: {.columns}\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../img/path-analysis-notes/03-weak-causal-path.png){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\nTo represent the correlation between motivation and achievement we have two potential tracings:\n\n1.

Cause does not operate backward in time. In our example, academic ability is well-documented as something that does not change after grade school. Thus, it would precede motivation and achievement in time. \n\n\n## A Little More About Cause\n\nWhat do we mean when we say \"*X* causes *Y*\"? Contrary to popular belief, we do not mean that changing *X* has a direct, and immediate change on *Y*. For example, it is now well known that smoking causes lung cancer.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../img/path-analysis-notes/09-smoking-cancer.png){fig-align='center' width=60%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nBut, not everyone who smokes ends up getting lung cancer.\n\n\n## A Little More About Cause (cntd.)\n\nInstead, cause is a probabilistic statement about the world. When we say smoking causes lung cancer what we mean, statistically, is that smoking increases the probability of developing lung cancer. \n\n<br />\n\nMoreover, this increased probability is due to smoking, and not something else.\n\n\n## Requirements for Cause\n\nThere are three primary requirements for a causal relationship between *X* and *Y*.\n\n1. There must be a relationship between *X* and *Y*. (Correlation is a necessary component of causation.)\n2. Time precedence (Causes must occur prior to effects.)\n3. Relationship must not be spurious. \n\n\n## Including Time Precedence in the Path Diagram\n\nTime precedence is often reflected in the orientation of the model. Variables that occur earlier in time are oriented further to the left side of the diagram than variables that occur later. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../img/path-analysis-notes/09-smoking-cancer.png){fig-align='center' width=60%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nIn the smoking example, to be considered the cause for lung cancer, smoking has to occur prior to the onset of lung cancer.^[Note that the top--bottom orientation typically doesn't mean anything---it is just used for aesthetics in the layout.]\n\n\n## Including Time Precedence in the Path Diagram (cntd.)\n\nIn our path diagram relating academic ability and motivation to acheivement, academic ability is furthest to the left (it occurs earliest), followed by motivation, and then academic achievement. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../img/path-analysis-notes/06-complete-est-weak-causal-model.png){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n## Common Cause\n\nA common cause is a variable that is a cause of both *X* and *Y* which accounts for the relationship between *X* and *Y*. Consider the following example where we want to look at the causal impact of participation in Head Start programs on academic achievement.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../img/path-analysis-notes/07-head-start-achievment.png){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nIn practice, the path coefficient tends to be negative. That is Head Start participants tend to have lower academic achievement than their non-Head Start peers.\n\n\n## Common Cause (cntd.)\n\nA common cause of both Head Start participation and academic achievement is poverty. This is shown below.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../img/path-analysis-notes/08-head-start-achievment-poverty.png){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nOnce we include poverty as a common cause, the path coefficient between Head Start participation and academic achievement switches direction. That is, after including poverty in the path model, Head Start participants tend to have higher academic achievement than their non-Head Start peers. This is akin to how effects in a regression model might change after we control for other predictors. \n\n\n## Common Cause (cntd.)\n\nIn order to meet the third causal requirement, we need to include ALL common causes in the model. This requirement is the hardest to prove.\n\n\n## Non-Recursive Models\n\nIn the path diagrams we have looked at so far, the causal paths have gone in only one direction; there is a distinct cause and effect. The error terms on the effect variables are also all uncorrelated. These are called *recursive models*. It is possible for variables to effect each other (e.g., predator--prey relationships), or for the error terms to be correlated. This is called a *non-recursive model*.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../img/path-analysis-notes/11-nonrecursive-model.png){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Under-Identified Models\n\nThe problem with estimating the path coefficients in the non-recursive model is it is under-identified. In our predator--prey model, we need to estimate four path coefficients, but only have three correlations (equations) from which to do so. We can't solve this without adding additional constraints! \n\n::::{.columns}\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../img/path-analysis-notes/12-nonrecursive-model-paths.png){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n$$\n\\begin{split}\nr_{\\mathrm{H,W}} &= p1 + p2(p4) \\\\[1em]\nr_{\\mathrm{H,R}} &= p2 + p1(p3) \\\\[1em]\nr_{\\mathrm{H,W}} &= p3 + p4 + p1(p2)\n\\end{split}\n$$\n\n:::\n\n::::\n\n\n## Over-Identified Models\n\n\n",
