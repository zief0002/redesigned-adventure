The chapters from *Monte Carlo Simulation and Resampling Methods for Social Science* should be accessible via the links after logging in with your x500 and password. \n\n- [Probability](https://dx-doi-org.ezp2.lib.umn.edu/10.4135/9781483319605.n2): Common probability distributions and how to compute with them.\n- [Random Number Generation](https://dx-doi-org.ezp2.lib.umn.edu/10.4135/9781483319605.n4): Learn how to draw random numbers from different distributions. Also information about repeating processes in R, including writing your own functions, using for loops, and using if-else functions.\n\n\n\n\n",
