    "text": "FAQs\nHow do I submit the assignment?\nCreate a PDF of your responses and submit the PDF via email to both the instructor and TA. Also cc any group members. Before you submit the assignment check that:\n\nAll group members‚Äô names are on the assignment.\nAll tables are numbered and have a caption.\nAll figures are numbered and have a caption.\nAll figures are re-sized to not take up more page space than is necessary to read them.\nNo R syntax is included unless the question specifically asked for the syntax to be included. If there is R syntax included, be sure that it is typeset in a monospaced font (e.g., Courier, Inconsolata).\nDo not submit the script file you used unless the directions specifically ask you to submit it.\n\nDo I need to turn in the script file?\nNo‚Ä¶unless the directions specifically ask you to submit the script file. The script file is for your reference. Future assignments will sometimes have questions that reference older assignments, so an organized and well-commented script file is a good idea. Moreover, the TA or myself may ask you to submit your syntax after you submit the assignment to help us interpret mistakes you made on the assignment so that we can provide more thorough feedback.\nWill you provide answer keys to the assignments?\nNo.¬†You will get back several comments on your assignments that address what you did wrong. The educational research is pretty clear that feedback is more helpful to student learning than providing correct answers. If you have further questions or need additional clarification, you are welcome to come to office hours or make an appointment with the instructor or TA.\nWill you go over the answers in class?\nNo.¬†I will address broad concepts if several students/groups made the same mistake, but otherwise, since each student/group makes unique mistakes going over the assignments more broadly is not a good use of our limited class time. The feedback should be helpful in understanding any mistakes you made, but if it isn‚Äôt, you are welcome to come to office hours or make an appointment with the instructor or TA.\nWill you look at our assignment prior to us submitting it?\nThe instructor or TA will not ‚Äúpre-grade‚Äù your assignment. If there is a ‚ÄúPreparation‚Äù part of the assignment we can ensure that you did that part correctly, and we can also give you feedback about syntax, but we will not tell you if an answer is correct or not. We can also answer clarifying questions (e.g., ‚ÄòI know Question 8 is asking about [‚Ä¶], but I‚Äôm not sure what this question is looking for. Is there another way to restate this question?‚Äô). If you completed the assignment without any trouble, then be confident in your work and simply submit the assignment! üòÑ If you are unsure about something specific, then ask about that specific thing rather than a general ‚Äòdid I do this right‚Äô!\nWill we be able to re-do the assignment?\nGenerally no. Since you have the opportunity to work in groups on the assignments, you should be able offset any of the issues that come up that would necessitate a re-submission. The exception to this is that we may allow you to re-do Assignment 1. If we do this, we will send you an email requesting that you resubmit part, or all of Assignment 1. You will not receive much feedback on your assignment prior to your re-submission. This is because during the first assignment you are learning not only content, but also expectations around how to respond to the questions we ask."

    "text": "Welcome to EPsy 8251: Methods in Data Analysis for Educational Research I\nEPsy 8251: Methods in Data Analysis for Educational Research I is the first course in an entry-level, doctoral sequence for students in education. The two semester sequence provides in-depth coverage of widely used statistical methods and models and prepares students for advanced statistical coursework. EPsy 8251 provides rigorous coverage of estimation and hypothesis testing with a particular focus on the General Linear Model. The roadmap for the course is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEPsy 8251 is a 3 credit course. It is expected that the academic work required of Graduate School and professional school students will exceed three hours per credit per week (see Expected Student Academic Work Policy). In my experience, it is typical for students to spend 10‚Äì15 hours a week on this course. As with every class, some students will spend more time than that on this course, while others will spend less time than that‚Äîit all depends on your prior experiences with statistics and computing. If you find yourself consistently spending more than 20 hours a week on the course, please make an appointment to see the instructor so that we can strategize about how to best optimize how you are devoting time to the course. \n\nA Note on Inclusion and Respect\nIn this class, we will work together to develop a learning community that is inclusive and respectful, and where every student is supported in the learning process. As a class full of diverse individuals (reflected by differences in race, culture, age, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic background, abilities, professional goals, and other social identities and life experiences) I expect that different students may need different things to support and promote their learning. The TAs and I will do everything we can to help with this, but as we only know what we know, we need you to communicate with us if things are not working for you or you need something we are not providing. I hope you all feel comfortable in helping to promote an inclusive classroom through respecting one another‚Äôs individual differences, speaking up, and challenging oppressive/problematic ideas. Finally, I look forward to learning from each of you and the experiences you bring to the class."

Submit each assignment as a PDF file via email to the TA.\nTo foster cooperation and collaboration, you are permitted to form groups of no larger than three to work on the homework. Submit only one assignment per group, and list the names of each group member on the assignment. Each assignment will be scored and this score will be given to all individuals in the group. From past experience, student collaborations work most fluidly when everyone in the group has chosen the same grading option for the course (e.g., A/F, S/N, etc.).\nIf you work alone on the assignments, you need to truly work alone. To protect against running afoul of the scholastic dishonesty policy, students working alone are not permitted to interact with any other student in regards to the assignment, including discussion, obtaining help, etc."

If you are in doubt as to whether you are using AI language models appropriately in this course, I encourage you to discuss your situation with me or the TA. Examples of citing AI language models are available at: https://libguides.umn.edu/chatgpt. You are responsible for ensuring any syntax composed by AI is correct.\n\n\nPolicy for Missing Class and Making up Missed/Late Work\nStudents are responsible for planning their schedules to avoid excessive conflicts with course requirements and must notify the instructor of unavoidable scheduling conflicts as early as possible. For circumstances where absences are unavoidable, accommodations for makeup work will be made according to University Policy. If you miss class:\n\nEmail the instructor as soon as you know you will be missing class.\nStudents are expected to obtain notes from a classmate of class material missed.\nPlease note that I will not be recording class sessions at the request of individual students, nor will I be Zooming students in to the class. Although, if you can arrange it with a classmate, they can Zoom you in.\n\nIf you are zooming in a classmate, please let the instructor know.\n\nIf you will be gone the day an assignment is due, you will need to make arrangements with the instructor about when you will turn in the assignment.\n\nIf you do not communicate with the instructor and make arrangements for turning in work when you are absent, the assignment will receive a 0.\n\n\n\nEvaluation of Student Performance\nCourse grades will be based entirely on performance on the homework assignments. The points from the eight homework assignment will be pooled to compute a percentage in the class, which will be converted to a final course grade using:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCutoff\nGrade\nDefinition for Graduate Credit\n\n\n\n\n93%‚Äì100%\nA\nFor exceptional work, well above the minimum criteria\n\n\n90%‚Äì92%\nA‚Äì\nFor outstanding work, well above the minimum criteria\n\n\n87%‚Äì89%\nB+\nFor excellent work, significant above the minimum criteria\n\n\n83%‚Äì86%\nB\nFor work above the minimum criteria\n\n\n80%‚Äì82%\nB‚Äì\n\n\n\n77%‚Äì79%\nC+\n\n\n\n73%‚Äì76%\nC\nFor work which meets the course requirements in every respect\n\n\n70%‚Äì72%\nC‚Äì\n\n\n\n63%‚Äì69%\nD\nWorthy of credit even though it fails to meet the course requirements\n\n\n0%‚Äì62%\nF\nFailed to meet minimum course requirements\n\n\n\nIf you are taking the course S/N, the minimum criterion to receive an S is 80% (the equivalent of a B‚Äì letter grade). The S grade does not carry grade points and is not part of the GPA calculation, but the credits will count toward the student‚Äôs degree program if allowed by the college, campus, or program.\nAny student who does not complete all homework assignments without making prior arrangements with the instructor will receive a grade of F/N.\n\n\n\nIncomplete\nInstructors may assign the registration symbol ‚ÄúI‚Äù for Incomplete if, at the time the incomplete is requested: (1) the student has successfully completed a substantial portion of the work of the course; and (2) due to extraordinary circumstances (as determined by the instructor), the student was prevented from completing the work of the course on time. The assignment of an ‚ÄúI‚Äù requires a written agreement with the student specifying the time and manner in which the student will complete the course requirements. For more information see Grading and Transcripts.\n\n\n\nAccessing Course Grades\nShortly after the course, you may access your grades online at myU. Assignments will be handed back in class or during office hours. Uncollected assignments will be retained for six weeks after the course and then discarded.\n\n\n\nStress Management\nStress management is an important piece of the skill set needed for success in graduate school. Pet Away Worry & Stress (PAWS) is one of the many resources available to students. Find out more at https://boynton.umn.edu/paws.\n\nYou can follow Tilly the Therapy Chicken on Twitter (@TherapyChicken)."

    "text": "Statistical Computing\nStatistical computing is an integral part of statistical work, and subsequently, EPsy 8251. To support your learning in this area, this course will emphasize the use of R. R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms, Windows and MacOS https://www.r-project.org. It should be noted that while some R syntax and programming is taught during class time, there is also a fair amount that you may need to learn on your own outside of class. There are several tutorials and resources linked from the course website to help you learn R.\nYou can install R and RStudio onto your local machine. (There are instructions for how to do this on the course website.) You are responsible for getting things to work on your computer. While it should be straightforward, each OS and computer has their quirks. I can try to help you with this if you are having trouble.\n\n\nTechnology Policy\nThe course uses technology on a regular basis during both instruction and assessments (e.g., homework assignments, exams, etc.). Student difficulty with obtaining or operating the various software programs and technologies‚Äîincluding printer trouble‚Äîwill not be acceptable as an excuse for late work. Due to the variation in computer types and systems, the instructor or TA may not be able to assist in trouble shooting all problems you may have.\n\n\n\n\nCEHD Policy on Recording Classes\nAll class sessions may be recorded by the instructor using the procedures in the CEHD Policy on Recording Classes, with or without prior notice. Students should assume that a class session is being recorded unless otherwise notified. No person (student or otherwise) may record a class without express written permission from the instructor or an authorized administrator implementing a disability accommodation. All permitted recordings are governed by this policy‚Äôs limits on distribution and redistribution of recordings."
