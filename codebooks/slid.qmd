The data in [slid.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zief0002/redesigned-adventure/main/data/slid.csv) includes a subset of data collected during the 1994 wave of Statistics Canada's *Survey of Labour and Income Dynamics* (SLID). These data constitute employed citizens living in Ontario, Canada between the ages of 16 and 65. These data are taken from the public-use dataset that was made available by Statistics Canada, and prepared by the Institute for Social Research, York University. They were made available in @fox:2022. The variables in the data set are:

- `wages`: Composite hourly wage rate based on all the participant's jobs
- `age`: Age of the participant (in years)
- `education`: Number of years of schooling
- `male`: A dummy-coded predictor for sex (0=Non-male; 1=Male)
