In 1964, the US Congress passed the Civil Rights Act and also ordered a survey of school districts to evaluate the availability of equal educational opportunity in public education. The results of this survey were reported on in @Coleman:1966 and @Mosteller:1972. The data in [equal-education-opportunity.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zief0002/redesigned-adventure/main/data/equal-education-opportunity.csv) are a subset of the data collected. These data, provided by @Chatterjee:2012, constitute a random sample of 70 schools from the original data. The attributes, which have all been mean-centered and standardized, include:

- `achievement`: Measurement indicating the student achievement level
- `faculty`: Measurement indicating the faculty's credentials
- `peer`: Measurement indicating the influence of peer groups in the school
- `school`: Measurement indicating the school facilities (e.g., building, teaching materials)
